It is hard to lose a parent at any age, but part of what you are grieving is all the parts of your life that are yet to unfold that your mother will not be able to witness. Whenever you have a significant milestone or achievement it might help to include her in some way.",

            "comment": "I think it must be especially hard to have lost her on your birthday. Sometimes when freshly bereaved we can find that certain dates have power over us. It will help to take a mindfulness attitude toward this: notice that you are off-colour on a particular date, but don't let the emotion hold you in its grip. A date is just a date.",

            "comment": "Grief is an intensely painful experience. Like physical pain and often the two are linked (ie. don't be surprised if you have physical manifestations of your emotional state). I can only say as one who has also lost a mother young, that you will never stop missing her, but the quality of the missing does change (becomes less intense). Hang in there.",

            "comment": "Have you tried a grief support group or speaking to a university chaplain? When my father died, I found a grief group and it really helped. Your grief should never be compared to someone else's grief experience, but grief is very isolating. It can make you feel estranged from your happy-go-lucky friends at university. Connecting with others who have some experience of great loss can make you feel not so alone.",
