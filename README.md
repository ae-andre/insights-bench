## Usage
In a world where connectivity often leads to isolation, it's common to feel like there's nobody to turn to during life's toughest moments. No matter what's on your mind or where you're coming from, you'll find a warm, empathetic listener here who's ready to walk alongside you through life's ups and downs. Take a seat, take a breath, and let's journey together towards brighter days :sunny:

Upon landing on the page, users will see a brief description of what 'Soul Bench' is about. As they scroll down the homepage, they'll discover hot topics that other users have recently been discussing. While users can view these discussions, they'll need to be logged in if they wish to join the conversation.

By clicking the 'Sign Up' button located under the 'Login' page, users can choose between two roles: Sharer or Listener. Depending on the role selected, users will be prompted to fill out a different form. Once signed up, users will be automatically redirected to the homepage. Returning users can simply sign in to check for updates on their paired buddy or their ongoing conversation.

For users signed up as Sharers, clicking the '+' button on the 'My Bench' tab will prompt them to fill out a form regarding what they would like to discuss and the qualities of the listener they are seeking. Clicking 'Find a Bench' will then match the Sharer with a Listener who possesses the desired qualities.

For users signed up as Listeners, the 'My Bench' tab will display a message if there's currently no paired Sharer.

To update their password, users can simply click on the 'Profile' button, enter their username, current password, and the new password.
